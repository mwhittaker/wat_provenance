- Provenance graphs for monotone datalog.
- Translating provenance graphs to how-provenance, why-provenance, and lineage.
- Extending provenance and provenance graphs to datalog with negation and
  aggregation.

``
Both lineage and Trio lineage have been defined for non-monotone operations
such as aggregation and negation operations. However, it is non-obvious how to
extend these definitions to why- or how-provenance while preserving their nice
properties
